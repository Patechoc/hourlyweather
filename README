HourlyWeather is a simple app/app widget for Android that generates a hourly forecast for your current location. 

I wrote it to help me plan my daily bicycle/motorcycle commute to work and outdoor activities.  Also even when I travel I the forecast comes with me without having to configure anything.

This was my first app for android and its quite a mess, be kind.
